    <h1>what is restricted hypertext markup</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>restricted hypertext markup, or more simply RHM, is a strict subset of XHTML1, which itself is a subset of HTML.</p>
    <p>RHM was created for the purpose of disallowing webpages that are syntactically valid but don't make logical sense.</p>
